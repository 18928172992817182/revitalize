# Revitalize

An app that integrates with the Google fit API and exposes a web interface to inspect the recorded data.

Hobby project used as a training exercise to explore new technologies.

## Getting it to run

We will be using flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

The reason I am going for flutter is because despite Typescript adding convenience to javascript, it is still just javascript. Flutter uses Dart. Why should we explore Dart when we already have javascript? I simply got interested after having seen Lars Bak do a talk about the history of web browser performance and development for the future which you can find here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4EB_k57g-I.
